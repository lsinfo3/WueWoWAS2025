# Reviewer guidelines

The goal of the review process is to provide constructive comments to the authors. In particular, we encourage constructive comments helping the researchers to improve the presentation of their work, and hints for further extension of the topic. For the weaknesses, provide helpful comments or recommended changes for future work, specifically regarding the applied methodology. Please also indicate the strengths of the paper. Some guiding questions are as follows, also included in the review form.
_What is the most significant strength of the paper?_
_If the authors did one more (experiment/thing) what should it be? _
_Is the structure of the storyline easy to follow?_

Additionally, the reviewers evaluate the overall merit and the presentation quality on a 5 point scale: (5:Strong accept, 4:Accept, 3:Weak accept, 2:Weak reject, 1:Reject)..
Overall merit: The paper must be sound, but scientific novelty may be limited by the 3-page format (plus 1 page for references). Performance evaluation studies, abstract models, and useful tools are equally welcome. _Is the problem formulation clearly described? Is the research carried out thoroughly? Are the discussions and conclusions detailed enough?_
Presentation and writing quality: _Is the structure of the text and the presentation of the results clear? Are the results and conclusions clearly described and reproducible? Are public data sets or open source code available?_

Each submitted paper will be reviewed by three reviewers, including at least one senior expert in the field. In addition, senior PhD students will be involved in the review process to provide further insights. We include them to help them gain experience with TPC reviews and learn from the process, while also benefiting from the fresh perspectives and up-to-date knowledge they bring through their active research. Their work often closely aligns with the topics of the submitted papers, making their contributions especially valuable.

The timeline for the review process is as follows:
- Paper Submission: 	11 July 2025  (fixed deadline, no extension) 
- Review Phase:	14 - 28 July 2025
- Acceptance Notification: 31 July 2025
- Workshop Registration: 31 August 2025
- WuWoWAS’25 Workshop: 6 - 8 October 2025 

Review load: To ensure a manageable workload, each TPC member is expected to review approximately 3–4 papers. Each paper is limited to three pages of content, with an additional page allowed for references only.
