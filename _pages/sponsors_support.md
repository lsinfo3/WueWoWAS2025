VDE, one of the largest technology organizations in Europe, has been regarded as a synonym for innovation and technological progress for more than 130 years.
The Information Technology Society (ITG) within the VDE e.V. is the national association of all those active in the field of information technology in business, administration, teaching, research, and science. Founded in 1954 as the Telecommunications Society, it is the oldest professional society within the VDE.

The “Communication and Distributed Systems” (Kommunikation und Verteilte Systeme, KuVS) special interest group fulfills a double role for scientists and researchers working in its topic areas: first, as a communications hub among them; second, as their representative body to other institutions. It is rooted in both the Fachbereich “Betriebssysteme, Kommunikationssysteme, Verteilte Systeme (SYS)” of the German Informatics Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Informatik, GI) and the Information Technology Society of VDE (Informationstechnische Gesellschaft, ITG).
