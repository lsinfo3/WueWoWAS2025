## Focus Theme
Our discussions revolve around a wide array of subjects, touching upon next-generation network paradigms such as 5G, 6G, IoT, and industrial networks. We cover conceptual frameworks vital for future networks, including softwarization, edge computing, and the integration of AI and ML, fostering automation. Additionally, we explore the assessment of network performance, reliability, and resilience through various means such as measurements, modeling, simulation, and analysis, with a focus on enhancing aspects like QoS, QoE, and energy efficiency among others. The workshop will take place in-person in W체rzburg, Germany.

We encourage PhD students, early career scientists as well as senior researchers to contribute early state and ongoing research or previously published hot topic papers in the form of extended abstracts. Accepted abstracts will be published open access through W체rzburg University Press and indexed in search engines and digital library catalogs. The goal of the workshop is to foster communication among researchers from industry and academia. To this end, invited experience talks and discussion slots on important topics Next-Generation Communication Networks are an integral part of the program.
