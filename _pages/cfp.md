# Call for Participation: KuVS Fachgespräch - Würzburg Workshop on 6G Networks (WueWoWAS’25)

6 - 8 October 2025, Würzburg, Germany https://lsinfo3.github.io/WueWoWAS2025/

The KuVS Fachgespräch - Würzburg Workshop on Next-Generation Communication Networks with a special focus on 6G Networks and related technologies (WueWoWAS’25) focuses on preliminary and ongoing research and previously published hot topic papers on next-generation communication networks (NGN). The central theme is 6G networks, covering advanced architectures, technologies and concepts that will enable the next generation of connectivity, intelligence and automation across multiple domains. General topics include but are not limited to

    • 6G architectures and technologies: converged and non-terrestrial networks, specialized networks e.g. industrial, IoT, lower power wide area networks, integrated communication and sensing, joint computation and communication, end-to-end perspective, etc.
    • Enablers and concepts for 6G networks: softwarization, edge computing, (explainable) AI and ML, automation, large language models (LLMs), real-time and time-sensitive networking (TSN), etc.
    • 6G use cases: critical infrastructures, industrial manufacturing, robotics, automotive, smart city, public safety, power and communication networks, healthcare, remote assistance, meta verse and network worlds, etc.
    • Evaluation and quantification: measurements, modeling, simulation, analysis on QoS, QoE, sustainability, energy efficiency, resilience, etc. as well as tradeoffs; interdependency evaluation, e.g. between power and communication networks, edge and cloud computing, wired and wireless connectivity, centralized and distributed architectures, etc.
    • Evaluation platforms and tools: open-source software for simulation and prototyping, useful tools and software frameworks, workflows for testbeds, reproducibility frameworks and benchmarking methodologies

The workshop will take place in-person in Würzburg, Germany on 6 -8 October 2025. We encourage PhD students, early career scientists as well as senior researchers to contribute early state and ongoing research or previously published hot topic papers in the form of extended abstracts no longer than 3 pages, with 1 additional page for references.

The goal of the workshop is to foster communication among researchers from industry and academia and provide a venue for early feedback. To this end, invited experience talks and discussion slots on important topics in NGN and 6G are an integral part of the program.

## Preliminary Program

The program will include regular presentation sessions with ample time for questions and discussion. Due to the very positive feedback, we will again organize a speedmentoring session with invited experts from academia and industry. Participants will have the opportunity to book slots with each of the invited experts to discuss their own work, recent developments, or other professional matters. The workshop will start on Monday morning and finish Tuesday afternoon. Wednesday is organized as a PhD Day, featuring speed mentoring, tutorial-style talks, and (hands-on) experience sessions.  Details regarding the workshop program will be provided at a later date.

    • Monday: keynote and technical sessions, social event
    • Tuesday: keynote and technical sessions
    • Wednesday: PhD day 

## Important Dates

    • Abstract registration and submission: 11 July 2025 (hard deadline)
    • Notification of acceptance: 31 July 2025
    • Registration for speed mentoring: 31 August 2025
    • Workshop registration: 31 August 2025
    • In-Person Event: 6 - 8 October 2025

## Paper Submissions

Authors are invited to submit original unpublished, early stage research written in English in PDF format. Submissions will be subjected to a peer-review process. Papers should be submitted in IEEE 2-column format, with paper length up to 3 pages excluding references (4 pages including references) through the EDAS conference management system. Accepted abstracts will be published open access through Würzburg University Press and indexed in search engines and digital library catalogs.
Previously published work should be submitted in the form of a short summary that highlights the key contributions made in the original document. The original publication should be clearly cited in the summary. Hot topic summaries should be no longer than 2 pages including references and will also be included in the open access publication.
Authors should register and upload paper submissions via the EDAS conference system: 	https://edas.info/N33713

## Registration

Workshop registration is handled via the EDAS Conference and Journal Management System. 
Participants are required to register by 31 August 2025
Participation fee will be 150€ for all participants (authors and non-authors) and covers participation, open access publication of accepted abstracts, drinks and lunch on all three days, as well as the social dinner on Monday evening.
