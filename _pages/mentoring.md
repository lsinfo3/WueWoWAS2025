# Speedmentoring

Following the very positive feedback from previous events, we are pleased to offer another **Speedmentoring Session** for PhD students.

This session provides a unique opportunity to engage directly with leading experts from both academia and industry. Participants will be able to book short, focused meetings to discuss their research, recent developments in the field, or broader career-related questions.

The Speedmentoring Session will take place on **Monday, October 6, 2025**, and **requires prior registration**. Please note that the number of available slots is limited and **exclusively reserved for participating PhD students**. We will make every effort to distribute the slots fairly among all registered participants.

Further details will be shared with registered attendees soon.
