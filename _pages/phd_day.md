# PhD Day

Wednesday, the third day of the workshop, is organized as a PhD Day, featuring speed mentoring, tutorial-style talks, and (hands-on) experience sessions. 

## Tutorial Schedule
### 9:00-10:30 - Introduction to Quantum Communication using Computer Science and Performance Evaluation Methods
**Speaker: Karim Samy Abelkhalek Elsayed, Univ. Hannover**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Details coming soon
</div>

***

### 11:00-12:30 - Energy Measurements, Metrics, Models
**Speaker: Fank Loh, Tobias Hoßfeld, Univ. Würzburg**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
In this tutorial, we will present methods for measuring power consumption in communication networks as well as software-based approaches for approximating the power consumption. Energy efficiency metrics from literature and standaridzation will be revisited. Furthermore, commonly used energy consumption models liked load-dependent or sleep-mode-aware models are introduced.
</div>

***

### 14:00-15:30 - Open RAN and 5G Campus Networks Setup and Measurements
**Speaker: Stanislav Lange, NTNU Trondheim**


<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
In this tutorial, we will discuss key building blocks for setting up a private 5G testbed using Software-Defined Radios (SDRs), open source software components such as OpenAirInterface and srsRAN, and off-the-shelf modems / phones. Furthermore, we will cover case studies highlighting research challenges as well as lessons learned in terms of measurement automation and reproducibility. 
</div>

***

### 16:00-17:30 - Resilience and Sovereignty Metrics and Models
**Speaker: Carmen Mas Machuca, UniBw München**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
This tutorial will give an overview of the different metrics that can be used to evaluate the sovereignty and resilience of a system. We will also present existing models for these metrics, as well as use cases where they have been applied.
